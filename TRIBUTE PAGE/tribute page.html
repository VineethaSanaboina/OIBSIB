                About the Father of JAVA.  
            </h1>  
<p>  
                ☛ James Arthur Gosling WAS BORN ON May 19, 1955 (age 68) in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. <br><br>
                ☛ Gosling attended William Aberhart High School in Calgary, Alberta. While in high school, he wrote some of the software to analyze data from the ISIS 2 satellite, working for the University of Calgary physics department.<br><br>  
                ☛ Gosling was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 2004 for the conception and development of the architecture for the Java programming language and for contributions to window systems. <br><br>
                ☛ He received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Calgary and his M.A. and Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, all in computer science.<br><br>
                      He wrote a version of Emacs called Gosling Emacs (Gosmacs) while working toward his doctorate.<br><br>
                      He built a multi-processor version of Unix for a 16-way computer system while at Carnegie Mellon University, before joining Sun Microsystems. <br><br>
                      He also developed several compilers and mail systems there.
                <br><br> ☛ Gosling was with Sun Microsystems between 1984 and 2010 (26 years). 
                <br><br>At Sun he invented an early Unix windowing system called NeWS, which became a lesser-used alternative to the still used X Window System, because Sun did not give it an open source license
                <br><br> ☛ He is known as the "father of the Java programming" language.
                <br><br>    He got the idea for the Java VM while writing a program to port software from a PERQ by translating Perq Q-Code to VAX assembler and emulating the hardware. He is generally credited with having invented the Java programming language in 1994.He created the original design of Java and implemented the language's original compiler and virtual machine.
                <br><br> ☛ For his achievement, the National Academy of Engineering in the United States elected him as a Foreign Associate member.
                <br><br> 2002: awarded The Economist Innovation Award.
                <br><br> 2002: awarded The Flame Award USENIX Lifetime Achievement Award.
                <br><br> 2007: made an Officer of the Order of Canada.The Order is Canada's second highest civilian honor. Officers are the second highest grade within the Order.
                <br><br> 2013: became a fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
                <br><br> 2015: awarded IEEE John von Neumann Medal
                <br><br>  2019: named a Computer History Museum Fellow for the conception, design, and implementation of the Java programming language.
                <br><br> ☛  Awards: Officer of the Order of Canada, IEEE John von Neumann Medal, The Economist Innovation Award NAE Foreign Member,Fellow Computer History MScientific career,Institutions	Sun Microsystems,Oracle Corporation,Google,Liquid Robotics,Amazon Web Services
